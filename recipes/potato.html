    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious side dish that pairs great with a  <a href="./steak.html">pan cooked steak.</a></p>
        <p>Similarly to the steak, the amount of ingredients for these potatoes is few. This recipe is a bit more complex, and needs more time to prepare. It's worth the extra effort though.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Russet or Yukon potatoes, cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>preheat the oven to 450 degrees</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water up to a boil, add salt to the water.</li>
            <li>While the water is heating, take the garlic, rosemary, and olive oil, and cook it in a pan until the garlic starts to turn golden.</li>
            <li>Strain the oil mixture into a bowl</li>
            <li>once the water is boiling, add the potatoes. once the pot is back to a boil, reduce to a simmer and stir.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes until a knife can poke into the chunk easily, about 10 minutes of simmering</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes, and then combine the oil, potatoes, and salt/pepper to taste in a mixing bowl. Shake the bowl roughly until the outside of the chunks has developed a layer of paste on the outside</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes to the oven for 20 minutes, then take a spatula to shake and turn the potatoes. </li>
            <li>Continue roasting the potatoes for 30-40 minutes longer, shaking occasionally.</li>
            <li>Take the finished potatoes and toss them in the cooked garlic/aromatics. add salt and pepper to taste. Serve Fresh.</li>
        </ol>
