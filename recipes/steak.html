    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for a very simple, easy, and quick pan cooked steak recipe. It uses simple flavors and a few ingredients to make a fantastic protien fast</p>
        <p>This steak goes great with a potato or roasted vegetable side, My personal recommendations being oven <a href="./broccoli.html">roasted broccoli</a> or <a href="./potato.html">crispy roasted potatoes.</a> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 inch thick steak, good candidates are: NY strip, rib eye, filet mignon</li>
            <li>Canola Oil (Or another high smoke point oil)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry the steak with a paper towel</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper, The seasoning will help to form a tasty crust</li>
            <li>Turn on stovetop to a medium-high to high heat and let it sit until the pan is very hot</li>
            <li>While the stove heats up, peel the garlic and crush it under the flat end of a knife. no need to mince finely.</li>
            <li>Add oil to the pan, once the oil is shimmering and moving with a water consistency you know the pan is hot enough</li>
            <li>place the steaks into the pan, release away from you so that oil doesnt splatter you. You should hear the sizzling of the steaks</li>
            <li>tilt the pan so that the oil pools on one side, and then cook the edges of the steak for about 1 minute each side</li>
            <li>Lay the steaks flat and leave them alone! let them sit undisturbed for the crust to form. once it has (about 3 minutes) flip the steaks.</li>
            <li>Cook on the other side for about 3 minutes</li>
            <li>In the final minute of cooking, add the butter, whole Rosemary and Thyme, and the garlic cloves to the pan</li>
            <li>While its finishing, take a spoon and baste the steak in the butter/oil</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks and let them rest 5-10 minutes, cut against the grain or serve whole</li>
        </ol>
